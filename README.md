# Gym Schedule Scraper
Scrapes a schedule page on my gym's website so I can import it into my Google Calendar.

Currently needs to be given a URL and be run manually.

Possible future improvements are listed below.

## Why?
- The schedule page on my gym's website is difficult to use, especially on mobile
- Learn and practice Node.js

## Possible Future Improvements
- [ ] Pull calendar event's description from the detail page for the class
- [ ] Host on a server
  - [ ] Users can sync to their Google Calendar
  - [ ] Users can add a single class to their Google Calendar without syncing the whole calendar
  - [ ] Depending on technical limitations, either:
    - alert when the current period's schedule is about to end
    - run itself when the current period's schedule is about to end
  - [ ] Scrape more/all class schedules
